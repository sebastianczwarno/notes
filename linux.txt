debian latest firefox:

Download Firefox for Linux (as provided by Mozilla) and extract it.

Head over to the Firefox download page and click the Download Now button to get the latest version of Firefox.

Extract the downloaded Linux Firefox build and move it to a folder on your system where your user has write permissions, so Firefox can auto-update itself. For example, you could move the Firefox folder into /opt/firefox, and change the /opt/firefox folder and /opt/firefox/firefox permissions to 755.

E.g. if you have the firefox folder extracted to your home directory, move it to /opt and change the /opt/firefox folder and /opt/firefox/firefox permissions to 755 (to allow it to auto-update) using:

sudo mv firefox /opt/
sudo chmod 755 /opt/firefox
sudo chmod 755 /opt/firefox/firefox
